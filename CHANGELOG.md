## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Full-Page Drop Zone for PDF to Markdown** (2025-11-14):
  - **Implemented full-page drop overlay**:
    - When dragging files over the page, a full-screen overlay appears with clear drop target
    - Overlay uses blue translucent background with backdrop blur for modern feel
    - Central white card with dashed border displays "Drop PDF files here" message
    - Automatically hides when files are dropped or drag leaves the page
    - Uses drag counter to track nested drag events correctly
  - **Technical implementation**:
    - Added `showDropOverlay` state and `dragCounterRef` for tracking drag state
    - Implemented `handlePageDragEnter`, `handlePageDragLeave`, `handlePageDragOver` handlers
    - Wrapped entire page content in drag event listeners
    - Fixed z-index layering with `fixed inset-0 z-50` positioning
    - Overlay has `pointer-events-none` to allow drop events to pass through
  - **UX improvements**:
    - Users can now drop files anywhere on the page, not just the small drop box
    - Clear visual feedback when dragging files over the page
    - More intuitive and forgiving file upload experience
  - **Impact**: Significantly improved drag-and-drop UX, making file uploads more intuitive
  - **Files Modified**: src/app/pdf-to-markdown/page.tsx
  - Build: ✅ | Lint: ✅ | Tests: ✅

### Changed
- **Clarified Folder Drop Limitations** (2025-11-14):
  - **Updated drop zone text**:
    - Changed "Drop PDF files or folders here" to "Drop PDF files here"
    - Added descriptive subtext to buttons: "Select individual PDFs" and "Select entire folder"
  - **Reasoning**: Browser security prevents drag-and-drop of folders - only the file picker with `webkitdirectory` attribute can access folder contents
  - **Impact**: Clearer messaging, no false expectations about folder drag-and-drop
  - **Files Modified**: src/app/pdf-to-markdown/page.tsx
  - Build: ✅ | Lint: ✅ | Tests: ✅

- **PDF to Markdown UI Improvements** (2025-11-14):
  - **Added visual separator** between drop zone text and file browser buttons
    - Cleaner visual hierarchy in file upload area
    - Better distinction between drop zone and action buttons
  - **Updated status message design** for consistency with UI
    - Changed from blue background (`bg-blue-50 border-blue-200`) to white card design
    - Now uses `bg-white shadow-md` to match other page sections
    - Improved visual consistency across all page elements
    - Applied to both single file and batch conversion status messages
  - **Impact**: More cohesive and professional UI, clearer visual hierarchy
  - **Files Modified**: src/app/pdf-to-markdown/page.tsx
  - Build: ✅ | Lint: ✅

### Added
- **Merge Markdown Functionality (PR 5)** (2025-11-14):
  - **Implemented core merge functionality**:
    - Merge multiple markdown files into a single document
    - Download merged file as "merged.md"
    - **Headers option** (checkbox, enabled by default):
      - Adds `# filename` (H1 heading) before each file's content
      - Independent of separator selection
      - Can be toggled on/off
    - **Separator option** (radio toggle between two styles):
      - **Newlines only** (default): Double newlines between files
      - **Page Breaks**: `---` horizontal rule between files
    - Merge button disabled when no files uploaded
    - Button label: "Merge & Download" for clear action indication
  - **Technical implementation**:
    - Added SeparatorStyle type: 'newline' | 'page-break'
    - Added addHeaders state (boolean, default true)
    - mergeMarkdownFiles() function handles content merging logic
    - handleMergeAndDownload() creates blob and triggers browser download
    - Preserves current file order (respects manual reordering and sorting)
    - Trims whitespace from file contents before merging
    - All merge options properly memoized with useCallback
  - **UX improvements**:
    - Checkbox for headers is more intuitive than radio buttons
    - Clear separation between headers and separators
    - Radio buttons for separator selection
    - Clear labels explaining each option
    - Comprehensive diagnostic logging:
      - Log when headers toggled (enabled/disabled)
      - Log when separator changed (newlines/page breaks)
      - Log merge operation start (files count, separator, headers)
      - Log successful merge (total files + output size)
      - Log successful download (filename)
      - Log errors with detailed messages
    - File size formatting in logs (B, KB, MB, GB)
  - **Merge logic**:
    - Headers (if enabled): `# filename\n\n` before each file's content
    - Separators between files (except first):
      - Newlines: `\n\n`
      - Page breaks: `\n\n---\n\n`
    - Content trimmed before joining to avoid excess whitespace
  - **Impact**: Users can now merge multiple markdown files with flexible header and separator options. The merge functionality respects file ordering (upload order, manual reordering, or alphabetical sorting), providing complete control over the final output.

### Fixed
- **Deduplication Hash Bug Fix** (2025-11-13):
  - **CRITICAL: Fixed overly-aggressive log deduplication** (src/contexts/LogContext.tsx:151-157):
    - **Problem**: Previous optimization used only data object keys for hash, ignoring actual values
    - **Impact**: Legitimate logs with same keys but different values were incorrectly deduplicated and lost
    - **Example**: Two errors with `{ message: "Error A", url: "/page1" }` and `{ message: "Error B", url: "/page2" }` had identical hashes (both: `"error:Console Error:message,url"`), causing the second to be silently dropped
    - **Solution**: Hybrid approach combining keys + value snippet
      - Uses sorted object keys (excluding timestamp) for structure
      - Adds first 32 characters of JSON.stringify(data) for value differentiation
      - Combined hash: `${type}:${message}:${dataKeys}:${dataValuesSnippet}`
    - **Result**: Deduplication now correctly preserves all unique logs with minimal performance cost
    - **Benefits**: Correctness (includes values) + Performance (limits stringify to 32 chars)
    - **Credit**: Bug identified by Codex automated code review

  - **Restored test API key as default**:
    - Put back `w4IU5bCYNudH_JZ0IKCUIZAo8ive3gc6ZPk6mzLtqxQ` as default
    - Pre-fills API key field for development testing
    - User clarified the key wasn't entered wrong, they wanted it pre-filled
  - **Removed API key censoring in logs**:
    - Changed from sanitized preview (`****...****`) to full key display
    - Shows complete API key in diagnostic logs: `apiKey: "full_key_here"`
    - No need for censoring during development phase
    - Makes debugging API issues much easier
  - **Fixed log persistence across page navigation** (CRITICAL FIX):
    - **Problem**: Logs were resetting when navigating between pages (home → help, etc.)
    - **Solution**: Store logs in localStorage (key: `'diagnosticLogs'`)
    - **Implementation** (`src/contexts/LogContext.js`):
      - Initialize state from localStorage on mount
      - Auto-save logs to localStorage whenever they change (useEffect)
      - Load logs from localStorage when page/component mounts
      - Clear from localStorage only when clearLogs() called
      - SSR-safe with window existence checks
    - **Behavior**: Logs now persist when:
      - Navigating between pages within site (home → help → pdf tool → etc.)
      - Clicking navigation links
      - Using browser back/forward buttons
    - **Logs only reset on**:
      - Manual "Clear" button click in diagnostic panel
      - Browser tab/window closed
      - Page manually refreshed (F5, Cmd+R)
      - Website crashes
    - **Benefits**: Complete session history visible across entire user journey
  - **Documentation Updates** (`CLAUDE.md`):
    - Added **"Purpose: Logs Are For Claude"** section
    - Clarified logs are primarily for Claude (AI assistant) debugging
    - Explained user benefit: logs useful for copying/pasting to Claude for help
    - Emphasized logs replace browser console/network tab/application state visibility
    - Added: **"Claude should feel free to enhance logging based on preferences"**
    - Encouraged Claude to add whatever logs/timing/context is most helpful
